# 5. Reflection 
What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?
The code was so difficult to read, but once we organized it
and understood what every part was doing we quickly refactored it.

What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
nothing really.

What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?
none

Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
learned about has_key?

How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?
Confident

Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
The refactored code. It looks a lot better and it is more efficient.

Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
reading the code, it was tough.
