# U2.W5: A Nested Array to Model a Boggle Boardh

# I worked on this challenge [Allison, Morgan].

boggle_board = [["b", "r", "a", "e"],
                ["i", "o", "d", "t"],
                ["e", "c", "l", "r"],
                ["t", "a", "k", "e"]]


# Part 1: Access multiple elements of a nested array

# Pseudocode
#define method called create_word
#give it the arguments board and coords (have coord be able to take more than one element)
#grab elements from boggle_board array then join them
#return the word from the boggle_board elements
#end

# Initial Solution
 def create_word(board, *coords)
    coords.map { |coord| board[coord.first][coord.last]}.join("")
  end



# Refactored Solution
# We think the code is fine as is

# DRIVER TESTS GO BELOW THIS LINE
  puts create_word(boggle_board, [2,1], [1,1], [1,2], [0,3])  ==  "code"  
  puts create_word(boggle_board, [0,1], [0,2], [1,2]) == "rad"

# Reflection 
#I found it odd that it seemed like the code was just given to us?
#OUTSTANDING QUESTION: Are you just giving us the code here?
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 2: Write a method that takes a row number and returns all the elements in the row.  

# Pseudocode
# First define method called get_row
# set parameters to game and row
#return game with row in brackets


# Initial Solution
def get_row(game,row)
    return game[row]
end



# Refactored Solution
#

# DRIVER TESTS GO BELOW THIS LINE
puts get_row(boggle_board,1) ==  ["i", "o", "d", "t"]
puts get_row(boggle_board,2) ==  ["e", "c", "l", "r"]
# Reflection 
#very simple


#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 3: Now write a method that takes a column number and returns all the elements in the column.

# Pseudocode
# define method get_col
#parameters set to game with default of boggle_board and col
# create empty array called column
# create a loop on game and make it push each array element index inputed to column

# Initial Solution
def get_col(game,col)
	column = []
    game.each do |x|
        column.push(x[col])
    end
column
end



# Refactored Solution

def get_col(game,col)
   game.map{|x| x[col]} 
end






# DRIVER TESTS GO BELOW THIS LINE
puts boggle_board[0][1] == "r"   # returns boggle_board[row_number][column_number]
puts boggle_board[2][1] == "c"
puts boggle_board[3][3] == "e"
puts boggle_board[2][3] == "x"
puts get_col(boggle_board,1)  ==  ["r", "o", "c", "a"]
