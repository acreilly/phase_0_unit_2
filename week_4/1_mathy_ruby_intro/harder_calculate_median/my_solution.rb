# Complete each step below according to the challenge directions and 
# include it in this file. Also make sure everything that isn't code
# is commented in the file.  

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].

# 1. Pseudocode

# What is the input? an array of numbers
# What is the output? (i.e. What should the code return?) the median of the numbers
# What are the steps needed to solve the problem?
# create a method called median with a parameter of array
# create a loop taking each element of the array
#Multiply each element in the array
#divide each element in the array by the length of the array


# 2. Initial Solution



# 3. Refactored Solution



# 4. Reflection
