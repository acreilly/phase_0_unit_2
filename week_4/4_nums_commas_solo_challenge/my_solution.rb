# U2.W4: Numbers to Commas Solo Challenge

# Complete each step below according to the challenge directions and 
# include it in this file. Also make sure everything that isn't code
# is commented in the file.  


# 1. Pseudocode

# What is the input? an integer
# What is the output? (i.e. What should the code return?) string with commas if number is over 1000
# What are the steps needed to solve the problem?
# create a method called seperate_commas
# if integer is less than 1000
	# return integer
# elsif integer is over 1000
	# turn integer to string
	# inject comma every 3 characters
	# return string
# else
	# return string of error

# 2. Initial Solution



separate_comma(1000)    
separate_comma(1000000) 
separate_comma(0)       
separate_comma(100)
# 3. Refactored Solution
