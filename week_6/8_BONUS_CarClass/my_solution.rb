As a video game player, I want to be able to create a new car and set it's model and color so I can customize it in the video game.
As a video game player, I need to be able to define a distance to drive so I can follow directions appropriately.
As a video game player, I'd like to be able to see the speed I am traveling, so I can properly accelerate or decelerate.
As a video game player, I want to be able to turn left or right so I can navigate a city and follow directions.
As a video game player, I want to be able to accelerate and decelerate the car to a defined speed so I can drive following the rules of the road.
As a video game player, I want to keep track of the total distance I have travelled, so I can get paid for mileage.

# U2.W6: Create a Car Class from User Stories


# I worked on this challenge [Allison, Morgan ].


# 2. Pseudocode
# create a class car
    #initalize with parameters of car
        #define instance variables
        # define speed = 0
    
    #define method called stylize with parameters of model and color
        #define the instance variables and set to the parameters
        
    #define method called distance with parameter of distance
        #define the instance varaible
        
    #define method called speed with parameter speed_limit
        # define the instance variable
    
    #define direction with parameter of direction
        #if "left" gfg
        
        #define speed
    
    
    #define total_distance
        
        
    #define stop
    
    
    #define last_move
